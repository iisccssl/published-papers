CONCERN 1a: Description of data sets. 

* We have expanded the description of the signatures.  Please see
  Section 4: the first paragraph titled "Experimental Setup".

* We have made the regular expression sets that we used available for
  download and provided a URL in the paper.


CONCERN 1b: Description of traffic traces.

* Please see the second paragraph following "Experimental Setup", where we
  describe the traces in more detail and provide a reason why we used 33 
  traces instead of one large trace.


CONCERN 2: How do these results compare against our NDSS'10 submission?

* The differences in results were because of BDD variable ordering. Please 
  see the third paragraph of Section 4 for a description of this.


CONCERN 3: Paper length and redundant material.

We cut the following material:
* Background material on NFAs.
* Background material on adapting 2-stride NFAs to the streaming model 
  and on alphabet compression. We have instead provided citations.


CONCERN 4: "Using Snort's regexp is a bit misleading ..."

* Our work focuses on the regex matching part with the packet payload. We use
  the regexps extracted from the PCRE part of Snort rules without changing their
  semantics. We have clarified this in Section 4 (description of the regular
  expression sets).


CONCERN 5: "It would have been nice to see a comparison with a
straight-forward DFA implementation" 

* Please see footnote 3.


CONCERN 6: "When comparing with NFAs, it would be good to say more
about the specific implementation used."

* Please see the paragraph following "Comparison with NFAs"
