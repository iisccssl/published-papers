@inproceedings{HRS+07,
	Abstract = {The SELinux mandatory access control (MAC) policy has recently added amulti-level security (MLS) model which is able to express a finegranularity of control over a subject's access rights.  The problemis that the richness of this policy makes it impractical to verify, by hand,that a given policy has certain important information flow properties or iscompliantwith another policy.  To address this, we have modeled the SELinux MLS policyusing a logical specification and implemented that specification in the Prologlanguage.  Furthermore, we have developed some analyses for testing theproperties of a given policy as well an algorithm to determine whether onepolicy is compliant with another.  We have implemented these analyses in Prologand compiled our implementation into a tool for SELinux MLS policy analysis,called \tool.  Using \tool, we verified some important properties of theSELinux MLS reference policy,namely that it satisfies the simple security condition and $\star$-propertydefined by Bell and LaPadula},

	Abstract = {Security-Enhanced Darwin (SEDarwin) is a port of access control elements derived from NSA\'s Security Enhanced Linux (SELinux) to Darwin, the Open Source core of Apple\'s Mac OS X operating system. Apple\'s Mac OS X operating system combines both Open Source and proprietary technologies into a widely-used, production-quality UNIX-based workstation. Because Darwin is available under an Open Source license, it is possible to add mandatory access controls while still maintaining compatibility with the large base of user space applications, proprietary graphical components, and programming frameworks. While it was straightforward to port many of the SELinux components, Darwin\'s unique architecture meant significant new engineering was necessary in order to provide SELinux-style access controls consistently across the entire system. This paper will describe the component technologies in Darwin, the areas of significant new development, and provide comparisons to SELinux.},

    with a type system tracing information flow.  Its purpose is
    basically to allow to write ``real'' programs and to automatically
    check that they obey some confidentiality or integrity policy.  In
    Flow Caml, standard ML types are annotated with security levels
    chosen in a user-definable lattice.  Each annotation gives an
    approximation of the information that the described expression may
    convey.  Because it has full type inference, the system verifies,
    without requiring source code annotations, that every information
    flow caused by the analyzed program is legal with regard to the
    security policy specified by the programmer.},
