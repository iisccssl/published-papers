	Abstract = {Security protocols are critical for protecting modern communication
infrastructures and are therefore subject to thorough analysis. However practical
implementations of these protocols lack the same level of attention and thus may
be more exposed to attacks. This paper discusses security assurance provided
by security-typed languages when implementing cryptographic protocols. Our
results are based on a case study using Jif, a Java-based security-typed language,
for implementing a non-trivial cryptographic protocol that allows playing online
poker without a trusted third party. The case study deploys the largest program
written in a security-typed language to date and identifies insights ranging from
security guarantees to useful patterns of secure programming.},

	Abstract = {Security-typed languages promise to be a powerful tool with which 
provably secure software applications may be developed. Programs 
written in these languages enforce a strong, global policy of nonin- 
terference which ensures that high-security data will not be observ- 
able on low-security channels. Because noninterference is typically 
too strong a property, most programs use some form of declassifi- 
cation to selectively leak high security information, e.g. when per- 
forming a password check or data encryption. Unfortunately, such 
a declassification is often expressed as an operation within a given 
program, rather than as part of a global policy, making reasoning 
about the security implications of a policy more difficult. 

In this paper, we propose a simple idea we call trusted declas- 
sification in which special declassifier functions are specified as 
part of the global policy. In particular, individual principals declar- 
atively specify which declassifiers they trust so that all informa- 
tion flows implied by the policy can be reasoned about in absence 
of a particular program. We formalize our approach for a Java- 
like language and prove a modified form of noninterference which 
we call noninterference modulo trusted methods. We have imple- 
mented our approach as an extension to Jif and provide some of 
our experience using it to build a secure e-mail client.},
