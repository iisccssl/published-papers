Consider another seller 7509.  This seller
specializes in CD/DVD drives fot notebook computers.  
In the auctions we looked at,
he starts with an extremely low start price.  This ranged from $2-$30
depending on the acution, and also advertises
a "buy-it-now" price from $99-$119.  For each item, the buy-it-now price 
is well above the price
that comparable items can be bought from other vendors, but we speculate
this is a marketing technique to make the actual auction prices look
more attractive.

The final price of this sellers auctions is typically $60-$80.  In a 
significant fraction of the auctions we looked at (13/xxx), there is
a buyer 21422, who bids exactly $66, 2 days before the end of the 
auction, but he is always outbid, sometimes by just $1.  This behavior
is consistent with shilling behavior described in [N].

(Note: shipping for his drives is $15)


/* comment - not for paper
Now consider seller 13928 ("alpa51".  He specializes in laptop memory.  
Like the
other sellers we have examined, he starts the bidding at low prices, generally
under $1.  Winning bids are $40-$60.  But there really isn't really 
anything very interesting to say about his auctions.  The frequent buyers
(like bob-bogutsky) bid extremely low, for example $5.  They are clearly
bargain hunters, not shills.

(Note: his shipping is $6)
