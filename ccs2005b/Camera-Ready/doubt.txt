I am confused by a few sentences in the last paragraph of Section 4.3. 
Please see these changes and let me know if I'm wrong.

positive correlation ($p$-value less than $0.02$~\cite{Ricestat})
between the seller's \emph{AMB} and \emph{ANB}. We found that a
polynomial fit best describes this correlation (the dashed line in
Figure~\ref{FigPricediff}). We define any seller whose \emph{ANB} is
not in the $95$\% confidence interval (the solid line) of this model
as abnormal with respect to the \emph{AMB}. Note that some sellers,
for example $10260$ from Section~\ref{SubSec10260Intuition}, have

high \emph{ANB}. Still, they are defined as abnormal. This indicates
that their high number of bids cannot be attributed solely to their
low minimum starting bid, and another explanation is necessary.
