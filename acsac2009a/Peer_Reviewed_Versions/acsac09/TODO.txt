TODO List:
1. Address comments from RAID'09.
2. Talk clearly about differences between plugins/BHOs and JSEs in
   Introduction.
3. Compare to related work by Jhala et al.

Main concerns from RAID'09 reviews:
1. Differentiate from prior work by Vogt et al. What do we contribute over
   prior work? How to justify lack of static analysis?
2. Limitations of dynamic taint propagation? Need discussion section.
   EXE file embedded in JSE itself?
3. More implementation details needed.
4. Performance: claim that Sabre can be always-on is "ridiculous".
5. False positives/Whitelisting needs to be better explained.

Work for Nathan Harper:
1. Optimize performance of the tool.
2. Dynamic slicing to locate whitelists.
