OP:
--
What does OP buy us?
- Plugin isolation, both for malicious and untrusted plugins.
- Communication monitoring across browser components.

What are its shortcomings?
- JS still within each Web page domain (so JS interactions with web pages are
	not monitored)

Browser-wide information flow? What is the need to do this?

Problem: Extension isoaltion. XPCOM Layer tracking


Chrome features:
---------------
* Multiple processes in the browser.
* Separate plugin processes to allow for better isolation (as in OP).
  Plugin crashes -> rest of browser does not crash.
* Javascript runs as a separate process? (Separate Javascript threads).
* What does V8 offer over SeaMonkey? It is a Javascript VIRTUAL MACHINE.
  Uses runtime code generation.
* Speculative JS execution in the presence of run time code generation.
* "Sandboxing"? To prevent malware downloads? To restrict the privileges
  of each process (each executes in a jail).
* What does Chrome offer for extension isolation? (not plugin isolation?)
