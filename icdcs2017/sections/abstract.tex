Intel's SGX architecture allows cloud clients to create enclaves, whose
contents are cryptographically protected by the hardware even from the cloud
provider. While this feature protects the confidentiality and integrity of the
client's enclave content, it also means that enclave content is completely
opaque to the cloud provider.  Thus, the cloud provider is unable to enforce
policy compliance on enclaves.

In this paper, we introduce \tool, a system that allows cloud providers to
ensure SLA compliance on enclave content. In \tool, cloud providers and clients
mutually agree upon a set of policies that the client's enclave content must
satisfy. \tool executes when the client provisions the enclave, ensuring that
only policy-compliant content is loaded into the enclave. \tool is able to
achieve its goals without compromising the security guarantees offered by the
SGX, and imposes no runtime overhead on the execution of enclave code. We have
demonstrate the utility of \tool\ by using it to enforce a variety of security
policies on enclave content.
