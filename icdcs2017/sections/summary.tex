\section{Conclusion}
\label{section:conclusion}
This paper presents the design and implementation of EnGarde, an enclave inspection library 
that preserves the security benefits offered by the SGX and allows the cloud provider to 
verify the client's SGX-based enclave against a set of policies mutually agreed by the 
cloud provider and the client. In EnGarde, the cloud provider and the client mutually trust 
the inspection library with policy enforcement. EnGarde achieves its goal by using SGX's 
hardware attestation and having an encrypted channel set up between the cloud provider 
and the client. EnGarde only allows the client content to execute if the content follows
mutually agreed policies. We have evaluated the effectiveness of EnGarde by using it to
enforce three popular security policies for various real world applications.
