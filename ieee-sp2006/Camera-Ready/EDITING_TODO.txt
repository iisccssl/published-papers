********* ALL DONE: Very satisfied with the whole paper ***********

1. Abstract       -- DONE: Very satisfied with it.

2. Introduction   -- DONE: Very satisfied with it.

3. Overview       -- DONE: Modulo checks, very nice.
* Checks:
  (1) Closing a xterm window does not involve Window_map 
      OK: MapWindow call is there, but xEvent is not there.
  (2) Typing to an xterm window does not involve Window_map
      OK: MapWindow itself is not there.
  (3) Typing to an xterm window does not involve Window_enumerate
  (4) Confirm about Window_enumerate

4. AID
* Checks: 
  (1) Does opening an xterm involve Window_Setattr?
  (2) What is Window_DrawEvent (difference from Window_Map)?
  (3) Check numbers carefully in text and crosscheck with table.
      - 95 distinct functions (change)
  (4) Out of 17 functions reported as performing Window_Enumerate
      only 11 actually do.
  (5) This simple heuristic is quite effective. 

5. ALPEN          -- DONE: Very satisfied with it.

6. Results        -- DONE: Modulo checks, quite nice.
* Checks:
  (1) Check that Window_Chprop only appears in change property traces.
  (2) Check that Cut and Paste only traces contain ProcSetSelectionOwner
      and ProcConvertSelection.
  (3) Check up on Attack I

7. Related Work   -- DONE: Very satisfied with it.

8. Conclusions    -- DONE: Very satisfied with it.

- Do a comparison against the NSA-based hook placement
- Intra and interprodcedural fingerprints for AID.
- Be careful about mentioning WHO REQUESTS THE OPERATION.



=====================================================================
Experiment-wise:
---------------
(1) Check that the False-positive and False-negative labels in Figure 4 are
    accurate (by checking for the code patterns in the trace)
(2) Check that the distinct function, distinct code pattern counts are all
    correct.
(3) Check that the root-causes in Figure 5 are INDEED root-causes.
(4) Check the value of |FP| (size of fingerprint set) of Figure 5.
(5) Check the variables in scope carefully (count both local and global, and
    document it carefully this time).
(6) Is Window_Enumerate the only Window operation for which static pattern
    matching fails? Check this once again.
(7) Compare the results that we have against the results of NSA placement.
(8) Contact NSA

Some good news: DeleteWindow: DestroyNotify (?)

More specific points TO BE CHECKED:
-----------------------------------
- Is Window_Map indeed WRITE of MapRequest and MapNotify? Change appropriately
  => DONE: Changed it to a BETTER idiom.
- Is the determination of subject and object for MAPSUBWINDOWS (shown in
  Figure~2), correct? If not, modify the text appropriately.
