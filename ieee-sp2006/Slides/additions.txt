As of 8th June, 2006, additions are:

(1) More detail on set-equation-based technique. Precise definitions
    and algorithm. How we deal with errors in labeling (with example)

(2) More detail (at a high-level, say 2-3 slides worth) on current work
    on basis-finding-based approach.

(3) Point out shortcomings: discuss these in detail.
     (i) Lack of completeness [not all fingerprints found].
    (ii) Security-sensitive operation-finding is still manual.
