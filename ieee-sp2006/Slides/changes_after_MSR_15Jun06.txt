Main changes to the talk, based upon feedback at MSR:

(1) The talk was very unclear about the portion on basis-finding.
    Either talk about this VERY clearly, stating precisely what
    the inputs are, and what the output is, or completely skip
    this part of the talk.

(2) Which part is automatic, and which part is not is not clear.
    Make it clear what is automatic, and what is not automatic.

(3) Find a good explanation for why protocol-level protection will
    not suffice. That is, why modify the code? Find also a good
    explanation for why protecting the API alone is not sufficient.
    Why should we look at low-level operations.
