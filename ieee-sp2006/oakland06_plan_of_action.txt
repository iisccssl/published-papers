1. Read papers on dynamic slicing algorithms: ICSE'03 and PLDI'04
   Goal: Understand the number of instructions generated in a trace.

2. Find a good reference for aspect-oriented programming.

3. Repeat experiments by recollecting traces, and re-performing measurements.
   Also, this time, carefully document procedure in notebook as well as in
   the paper.

4. Read papers by Jeremy Epstein on X11 security.

5. Cut a lot of the irrelevant citations and add relevant, meaningful
   citations.

6. Tone down the "automation" aspect of things.


Targets for Oakland paper:
(1) The experimental results must be precise:
    
    * The number of functions in the trace, as well as 
      the number of distinct events in the trace must 
      be precisely recorded.
    
    * The size of RC must be recorded, and also the
      root-causes must be correctly recorded.
      Create      OK
      Destroy     OK
      Map         OK
      Unmap       OK
      Chstack     OK
      Enumerate   Check (in set-diff?)
      Chprop      OK
      GetProp     OK
      InputEvent  OK
      DrawEvent   Check (in set-diff?)
      Move        OK    (but check correctness)
    * Measure the number of global variables as well.
 
(2) The related work must be complete.
