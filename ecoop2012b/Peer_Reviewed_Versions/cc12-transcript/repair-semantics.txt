Transcript provides transactional execution for event-driven programs.
In an event-driven program, the code belonging to the program executes
in chunks. Upon finding a security alert, Transcript's undo model restores
the state of the Web application back to the last known good checkpoint, 
i.e., the point before the current chunk execution. Changes made by other
chunks belonging to the program that have already been committed are not
undone.
