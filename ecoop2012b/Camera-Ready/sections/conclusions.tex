\mysection{Conclusion}
\label{section:summary}

Our research shows that extending \js\ with support for transactions allows
hosting Web applications to speculatively execute and enforce security policies
on untrusted guests. Speculative execution allows hosts to cleanly and easily
recover from the effects of malicious and misbehaving guests. In building
\txjs, we made several contributions, including suspend/resume for \js, support
for speculative DOM updates, and novel strategies to implement transactions in
commodity \js\ interpreters.
