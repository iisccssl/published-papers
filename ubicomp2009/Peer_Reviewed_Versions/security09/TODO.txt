Why is endpoint generation the same as path generation?
   Why does it suffice to generate similar endpoints in order to get similar
   paths? Can we provide some intuition for this? Or is this just a design
   decision that simplifies implementation and yet yields good results?

Arati's comment: "Statistically similar" must be made clearer earlier in the
	paper.

"Performance": Don't we contradict ourselves in the paper when we mention range
queries we have poorer performance? Also mention that cloaked region radius
depends on distribution of vehicles. Also mention POI density.
