Weaknesses in NDSS'09 Submission, that we should address in a revision:

* Control Checker should work on sequences of ioctl calls, not sets of ioctl
  calls. We need to evaluate this using metrics developed for syscall based
  intrusion detection.

* We need to talk about how the k-driver can be secured.

* We need to make clear why removing code from the TCB makes the system
  any more secure. That is, what do our techniques buy over SafeDrive?
  We argue that the k-driver can possibly be secured using SafeDrive but
  don't say why this is easier than securing the entire device driver
  using SafeDrive. 

  Action item: Possibly implement an attack that SafeDrive cannot prevent.
  Download SafeDrive and show that the attack is STILL possible after
  securing the driver with it.

* We need to better analyze the false positive rate of our work. That
  is, what if the invariants result in false positives during enforcement?
  What workloads do we use for training and what for testing?

* We need to do a better job of talking about the methodology used to mine
  invariants.
