Oakland vs. DSN debate:

Pros of sending paper to Oakland:
* It's out of our desk soon.
* It's good to try the paper at a top venue for at least two times.
* It's basically a good paper, and had some good comments from reviewers.

Cons of sending to Oakland:
* The paper is incremental in its contribution.
* The paper was rejected from NDSS without discussion.
* The paper may come back on Jan 30th with much the same reviews.
* We don't have the stronger version of Control Checker.
* We can't prevent against several classes of attacks that Nexus can prevent.
* We don't have good experimental results for Daikon.
* We don't have good results with the attacks.
