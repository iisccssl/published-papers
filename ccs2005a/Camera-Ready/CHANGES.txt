Thematic changes:
(1) Automation: Don't idioms ruin complete automation?
(2) Errors: Don't idioms introduce errors?
(3) Writing style: Intuitive idea of idioms to come earlier.
(4) Relevance: Must mention that concepts generalize beyond LSM.
(5) Hooks don't authorize operations. They check that operations 
    are authorized by the policy.

Changes to the CCS paper:
(1) Introduction.
  * Relevance: must focus less on LSM, and more on generic technique.
  * Automation: tone down the "automatic" part, and include discussion
    on idioms.
(2) Conceptual operations.
  * Relevance: Increase discussion on relevance of the technique.
(3) Auth hook placement using static analysis.
  * Automation: include details on idiom-based analysis.
  * Errors: include a precursor to the "idioms" definition.
  * Errors: TOCTOU not our problem should be mentioned here.
  * Writing Style: Reduce the verbosity of the expanation for code examples.
  * Automation/Errors: Section 3.2.2: Rewrite completely:
    + Include discussion on how you wrote idioms.
    + Include discussion on how to refine idioms.
    + Include discussion on adding conjucts and new idioms.
  * Automation/Errors: Explain idiom completeness better.
  * Check the correctness of Find_CKF.
(4) Results.
  * Results in tabulated form?
  * Make "Methodology", "FP", "FN" separate subsections.
  * Redo CKF experiments.
(5) Appendix.
  * Create idioms.html


Consistency note:
- You use security_inode_rmdir in the intro, but selinux_inode_rmdir in the
	later part of the text. This WILL cause confusion.
