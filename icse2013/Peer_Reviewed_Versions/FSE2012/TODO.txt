Desirable additions to the FSE'12 submission:

1. Probabilistic inference of method argument mappings. We need to formulate a
   factor (or factors) for this. Right now, the fact that we only infer method
   mappings is a big, gaping shortcoming of the technique.

2. Modifying the tool to use the probability parameters used in the paper and
   seeing how the results differ (if they do), e.g., using 0.5 for UNDECIDED.

3. Sensitivity analysis of probability parameters. We have used a single
   parameter for our probabilities. How sensitive are the results that we
   obtained to changes in the parameters? This is very important to ensure
   that our results are not simply an artifact of setting specific parameters
   in our algorithms.

4. Extending the mapping to work with sequences of method calls rather than
   just working with individual methods. Will require a major overhaul of the
   factors that we use.

Easy additions:
1. Add performance data: size of factor graphs, time required for inference,
   etc.
2. Add some examples of real mappings inferred by Rosetta.
3. Add a limitations section.
