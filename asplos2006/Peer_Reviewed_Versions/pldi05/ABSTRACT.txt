We present the design, implementation, and evaluation of HIFI, a dynamic
analysis tool that finds heap-based bugs using anomaly detection. HIFI is based
upon the observation that, in spite of the evolving nature of the heap, several
of its properties remain stable.  HIFI uses this observation in a novel way:
periodically, during the execution of the program, it computes a suite of
metrics which are sensitive to the state of the heap. These metrics track heap
behaviour, and the stability of the heap reflects quantitatively in the values
of these metrics. The ranges of stable metrics, obtained by running a program
on multiple inputs, are then treated as indicators of correct behaviour, and
are used in conjunction with an anomaly detector to find heap-based bugs. We
demonstrate, using several examples, that HIFI is an effective bug finder.
