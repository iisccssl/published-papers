1) Metric Stability study:
  - We only performed metric stability study for a few benchmarks. We should
    have done this for all the benchmarks from the SPEC Suite.
  - We only used the test data suite for the study, we should have used train
    and ref input data sets instead.

2) Bug-finding:
  - We should have used a larger training set to create models.
  - We only found injected bugs.
  - We only showed that we found the bug with the *same* input with which we
    trained.
  - We did not analyse the false-positive or false-negative rate of our tool.
  - We do not have a diagnostic front-end that tells which statement caused
    the bug. We got away with it because we only tested injected bugs.

3) Overhead:
  - Logging every memory write instruction is too costly.
