If we need space for the submission, employ, in order, the following hacks:
1. Reduce the size of the figures.
2. Remove lists, and use manual numbering instead.
3. Try to hack into the ACM SIG format, and remove the copyright paragraph.
4. Remove "widows" from the text.

If we have too much space on our hands, use the following tricks:
1. Make the bibliography size bigger.
2. Switch to regular font, do not use times font.
3. Do not use your mylist environment, switch to regular list environment.
