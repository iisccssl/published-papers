<P>
Commodity operating systems achieve good performance by running device drivers
in-kernel. Unfortunately, this architecture offers poor fault isolation.  This
paper introduces microdrivers, which reduce the amount of driver code running
in the kernel by splitting driver functionality between a small kernel-mode
component and a larger user-mode component. This paper presents the microdriver
architecture and techniques to refactor existing device drivers into
microdrivers, achieving most of the benefits of user-mode drivers with the
performance of kernel-mode drivers. Experiments on a network driver show that
75% of its code can be removed from the kernel without affecting common-case
performance.

1. Introduction
</H2>

<P>
Bugs in device drivers are a major source of reliability problems in commodity
operating systems. For instance, a recent Microsoft report indicates that as
many as 85% of failures in Windows XP stem from buggy device
drivers&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="hotos2007.html#orgovan03">19</A>].

<P>
The root of the problem is the architecture of commodity operating systems.
They are designed as <I>monolithic kernels</I> with all device drivers (and
other kernel extensions), residing in the same address space as the kernel.
This architecture results in good performance because invoking driver
functionality is as easy and efficient as a function call.  Unfortunately, this
also results in bloated operating systems and poor fault isolation. For
example, kernel extensions constitute over 70% of Linux kernel
code&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="hotos2007.html#cyc+01">6</A>] (a large fraction of these are device drivers), while over
35,000 drivers exist on Windows XP desktops&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="hotos2007.html#murphy04a">18</A>]. A single bug
exercised in any one of these extensions suffices to crash the entire operating
system.

<P>
Several architectures have been proposed to isolate faults in device
drivers&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="hotos2007.html#minix3">1</A>,<A
 HREF="hotos2007.html#eko95">9</A>,<A
 HREF="hotos2007.html#fgb91">10</A>,<A

 HREF="hotos2007.html#sbl05">22</A>,<A
 HREF="hotos2007.html#yab+86">25</A>]. For example,
<I>microkernels</I> run device drivers as user-mode processes. A bug
exercised in a device driver only results in the failure of the user-mode
process running that driver. This approach, however, has two key problems.
First, this architecture is not compatible with commodity operating systems,
which are designed as monolithic kernels. Providing support for user-mode
device drivers in commodity operating systems thus requires kernel
modifications and rewriting device drivers&nbsp;[<A HREF="hotos2007.html#c04">7</A>, <A
HREF="hotos2007.html#lcf+05">14</A>]. Second, switching between the kernel and
a user-mode device driver involves the costly overhead of changing protection
domains.  For devices such as high-throughput network cards, this can result in
significant latencies and performance penalties [<A
HREF="hotos2007.html#sbl05">22</A>,<A HREF="hotos2007.html#vanmaren99">23</A>].
A common escape hatch employed in such cases is to implement drivers within the
kernel, which defeats the benefit afforded by microkernels.

<P>
This paper presents a new architecture for device drivers called
<I>microdrivers</I>. Microdrivers seek the middle ground between monolithic kernels and
microkernels, and improve reliability while maximizing performance. In a microdriver,
the functionality of a device driver is <I>split</I> between a kernel-mode
component and a user-mode component (<A HREF="#figure:rf-overview">Figure 1</A>).  The
kernel-mode component contains critical and frequently used functionality, such
as interrupt handling and performance-critical operations (<I>e.g.,</I>&nbsp;sending and
receiving network packets and processing SCSI commands), while the user-mode
component contains non-critical and infrequently used functionality
(<I>e.g.,</I>&nbsp;startup/shutdown and error-handling). The user-mode component is
implemented as a standalone process that is called from the kernel-mode
component.  Together, they provide the functionality of a traditional device
driver.

<P>
Microdrivers are motivated by a simple mantra: <I>reduce the amount of code
running in the kernel to improve its reliability</I>.  As discussed in
<A HREF="#section:case">Section 2</A>, more than 70% of device driver code contains
non-critical functionality. By relegating this code to a user-mode process, 
a microdriver reduces the amount of code running in the kernel and improves the
reliability of the system as a whole.  In addition, because the kernel-mode
component of a microdriver is much smaller than the entire driver, it is amenable to
verification and code audits.

<P>
Perhaps the most important aspect of microdrivers is compatibility with
commodity operating system architectures--device drivers written for monolithic
kernels can be <I>refactored nearly automatically</I> into microdrivers. This
provides a path to execute device drivers written for commodity operating
systems in user-mode without sacrificing performance. Prior efforts at
user-mode device drivers have either required rewriting the driver
completely&nbsp;[<A HREF="hotos2007.html#c04">7</A>,<A
HREF="hotos2007.html#lcf+05">14</A>] or impose significant performance
penalty&nbsp;[<A HREF="hotos2007.html#vanmaren99">23</A>].  We show that
program analysis techniques can automatically identify critical functions in a
device driver, following which a semantics-preserving transformation can split
the driver into a user-mode and a kernel-mode component. We discuss the design
and implementation of such a refactoring tool in <A
HREF="#section:refactor">Section 4</A>.  We used this tool to refactor the
e1000 device driver for the Intel PRO/1000 gigabit network adapter into a
microdriver. The kernel-mode component of this microdriver contains just 25% of
the code of the entire microdriver. Our preliminary experience with this
microdriver indicates that overheads for common-case performance and CPU
utilization are negligible.

2. The case for microdrivers
</H2>

<P> Because device drivers communicate with I/O devices, their performance is
critical to ensure fast I/O. Conventional wisdom holds that
performance-critical functionality must be implemented in the kernel.  Even
undergraduate texts preach that I/O algorithms must be implemented in the
kernel for good performance&nbsp;[<A HREF="hotos2007.html#sg99">21</A>,
page&nbsp;427]. Unfortunately, a popular interpretation of this tenet is that
device drivers must reside in the kernel.  This has lead to the monolithic and
unreliable operating systems that we see today.

<P> Surely, the <I>entire driver</I> does not reside on the
performance-critical path? To answer this question, we conducted a study of 455
device drivers, comprising network, SCSI and sound drivers from the Linux
2.6.18 kernel, and identified performance-critical functions in each of them.
To do so, we extracted the static call-graph of each driver--this graph has an
edge from <I>f</I> to <I>g</I> if function <I>f</I> can potentially call
function <I>g</I>. We resolved calls via function pointers using a simple
pointer analysis that is conservative in the absence of type-casts--each
function pointer can resolve to any function whose address is taken, and whose
type signature matches that of the function pointer. 

<P> We then identified a set of <I>critical root functions</I> that are driver
entrypoints that must execute in the kernel for high performance. Critical root
functions are those that handle interrupts or execute at other high-priority
levels (<I>e.g.,</I>&nbsp;tasklets, bottom-halves), and functions that supply
data to or receive data from a device. We define performance-critical functions
to be critical root functions plus the functions that they transitively call.
Given a template of the entrypoints, critical root functions can be identified
automatically for each family of drivers:&nbsp;<I>e.g.,</I>&nbsp;functions that
transmit network packets are critical for network drivers, while functions that
process SCSI commands are critical for SCSI device drivers. We wrote a tool to
automatically identify critical root functions (based upon their type
signatures) and the functions that they transitively call.

<CAPTION ALIGN="BOTTOM"><STRONG>Figure 2: Classification of functions in
different families of Linux device drivers.</STRONG></CAPTION>
</DIV>

<P> <A HREF="#figure:classification">Figure 2</A> shows the results of our
study.  We found that fewer than 30% of the functions in a driver are
performance critical. The remaining functions are called only occasionally,
<I>e.g.,</I>&nbsp;during device startup/shutdown, to configure device
parameters, and to obtain diagnostic information. Consider, for example, the
e1000 driver, one of the drivers considered in our study. Critical root
functions for this driver include the interrupt handler, the function to
transmit network packets, and callback functions registered with the kernel to
poll the device. This driver contains 274 functions (containing approximately
15,100 lines of source code). Of these, just 25 functions (containing
approximately 1,550 lines of source code) were classified as critical. It
suffices to execute just these functions in the kernel for good performance.
Relegating the remaining functions, which handle startup/shutdown and get/set
device parameters, to a user-mode process will greatly reduce the amount of
code running in kernel space without adversely impacting common-case
performance. Note that our estimate of critical device driver code is
conservative, because we only identify critical functions. It is likely that a
finer-grained approach will show that even less code is on the critical path.

<P> Three factors lead us to believe that implementing non-critical
functionality as a user-mode process will also improve system reliability and
availability as a whole. 

<P> First, fault isolation improves. Any bugs that crash the user-mode process
of a microdriver will potentially render the corresponding device unusable but
will not affect the rest of the operating system. The device driver can then be
restarted in isolation to restore operation of the device. Note that because
the kernel-mode component of a microdriver implements critical device
functionality, such as interrupt processing, it is possible to keep the device
operational even if the user-mode process crashes. For example, the kernel-mode
component can implement error-checking code that detects that the user-mode
process has crashed, and wait until the process restarts. However, as it does
so, it can still serve other requests to/from the device.

<P> Second, because the kernel-mode component of the microdriver implements
critical and heavily-used functionality, this code is likely more heavily
tested than the user-mode component. Further, because the kernel-mode component
is a relatively small entity, it can either be verified, subject to thorough
code audits, or be protected with mechanisms such as SFI&nbsp;[<A
HREF="hotos2007.html#wlg93">24</A>]. 

<P> Third, because the kernel-mode component and the user-mode component of a
microdriver communicate via a narrow interface (as desribed in <A
HREF="#section:arch">Section 3</A>), data passed between the kernel- and
user-mode components can be sanity-checked for errors. For example, a bug in
the user-mode component may introduce a dangling pointer in a data structure
that it then passes to the kernel. However, the corrupted data structure can be
detected using error-checking code implemented at the interface, thus
potentially preventing corruption of kernel data structures. 

<P> Indeed, the tenet that reduced code in the kernel means improved
reliability has also been recognized by many others&nbsp;[<A
HREF="hotos2007.html#b05">4</A>,<A HREF="hotos2007.html#c04">7</A>,<A
HREF="hotos2007.html#eko95">9</A>,<A HREF="hotos2007.html#l04">13</A>], and is
an important motivation for microkernels. This has resulted in several
services, that were previously implemented in the kernel, being implemented in
user-mode (<I>e.g.,</I>&nbsp;kernel module loaders, AFS). There have also been
several recent efforts to redesign device drivers (in particular, graphics
drivers) with the goal of reducing the amount of code running in the
kernel&nbsp;[<A HREF="hotos2007.html#b05">4</A>,<A
HREF="hotos2007.html#l04">13</A>].  

<P> Finally, microdrivers also allow vendors to take advantage of user-level
tools such as profilers and debuggers during the driver development process.
Comparable tools for developing kernel code are fewer in number and not as
advanced because kernel programming represents a smaller market and a more
challenging target. 

<P> Of course, microdrivers are not a panacea for device driver reliability
problems.  A&nbsp;bug in the kernel-mode component of a microdriver could still
crash the operating system. It is also possible that by splitting functionality
between a user-mode and kernel-mode component, microdrivers can expose
otherwise latent bugs. For example, a latent race condition in a device driver
could potentially be exposed in its microdriver implementation.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00030000000000000000"></A>
<A NAME="section:arch"></A><BR>
3. Architecture of a microdriver
</H2>

<P> A microdriver consists of a kernel-mode component that implements critical
functionality and a user-mode process that implements non-critical
functionality. Device driver functionality is split between the kernel-mode and
user-mode components at function boundaries. The two components communicate
using an LRPC-like mechanism&nbsp;[<A HREF="hotos2007.html#bal+90">3</A>]. In
the kernel-mode component, direct calls to functions implemented in the
user-mode component are replaced with upcalls through stubs. Stubs marshal data
structures accessed by the called function and unmarshal them when the call
returns. A symmetric downcall mechanism enables the user-mode component to
invoke kernel functions. To handle multiple requests from the kernel-mode
component, the user-mode process is multithreaded. 

<P> An object tracker, similar to the one used by Nooks&nbsp;[<A
HREF="hotos2007.html#sbl05">22</A>], synchronizes copies of a data structure in
the kernel's address space and the user-mode process' address space. It has
three main functions.

<P> First, the object tracker is invoked during marshaling/unmarshaling to
translate pointers between address spaces. This ensures that updates to a data
structure in one address space are reflected on its copy in the other address
space. Doing so is challenging for complex data structures such as arrays,
whose elements are accessed as offsets from the start of the data structure.
The object tracker must explicitly store the range of such data structures and
ensure that accesses via offsets are translated correctly between address
spaces. 

<P> Second, the object tracker ensures that data structures
allocated/deallocated in one address space are also allocated/deallocated in
the other. Allocations are dealt with during pointer translation--a new data
structure is allocated and initialized in an address space if no corresponding
copy is found in that address space. Dealing with deallocations is more
challenging. Deallocator functions must update the object tracker's database by
removing the entry for the data structure being deallocated. 

<P> Third, the object tracker manages synchronization of shared data
structures.  Two copies of a shared data structure can exist in a microdriver,
one in each address space, only one of which must be modified at any time. To
support concurrent accesses to such data structures, the user-mode process must
synchronize with the kernel to acquire a lock on a shared data structure.  The
object tracker must ensure that any updates to a shared data structures in one
address space are reflected to its copy in the other address space. 

<P> In addition to the basic functions described above, the object tracker can
optionally include error-checking code to check for a variety of common data
structure corruptions, such as dangling pointers and potential null-pointer
dereferences.

<P> Several enhancements are possible to the basic architecture of a
microdriver.  Functions that are repeatedly called from both the kernel-mode
component and user-mode component can potentially be replicated in both
components, thus avoiding the overhead of an address-space change each time the
function is accessed. Similarly, a frequently-accessed data structure can be
allocated in a shared memory region that is accessible both to the kernel and
the user-mode process. Finally, to ensure fast operation of the user-mode
process, the operating system can pin the process' pages to memory. 

<P>

<A NAME="section:refactor"></A><BR>
4. Refactoring device drivers to microdrivers
</H2>

<P> Microdrivers present the same interface to the kernel as traditional device
drivers, and are thus compatible with commodity operating systems.  Moreover,
code to implement upcalls, downcalls, marshaling and unmarshaling follows a
standard template and can be automatically generated. This section presents the
design of a tool that statically refactors traditional device drivers into
microdrivers (see <A HREF="#figure:annotsplit">Figure 3</A>). Such a tool
preserves the investment in existing device drivers and provides a migration
path to create microdrivers.  

<P> The refactoring tool has two functions. First, it must analyze the device
driver and determine which functions are critical. This is achieved by the
<I>splitter</I>. Second, it must move the remaining (non-critical) functions to
a user-mode component, and generate code for communication between the
kernel-mode and user-mode components. This is achieved by the <I>code
generator</I>.

<P> <b>The splitter.</b> The splitter analyzes the device driver and determines
how functions implemented in the driver must be split between kernel-mode and
user-mode. It builds a static call-graph of the driver (including edges for
indirect calls), identifies critical root functions, and classifies functions
transitively called by them as critical, as described in the study in <A
HREF="#section:case">Section 2</A>. Critical root functions need to be
identified just once for each family of device drivers.

<P> While this simple propagation-based approach to identify critical functions
has worked well for drivers that we have considered so far, the splitter can
employ more sophisticated algorithms that use dynamically gathered profile
information. For example, critical functions can be inferred by solving an
optimization problem on the static call-graph modeled as a <I>flow
network</I>&nbsp;[<A HREF="hotos2007.html#amo93">2</A>] with weights on edges
and nodes. Edge weights denote call frequencies (obtained by profiling) and
node weights are proportional to the number of lines of code in the function
denoted by the node. The goal is to find a cut in the graph under the
constraint that all nodes representing critical root functions must appear on
one side of the cut (the critical side).  Additional constraints can also be
imposed, <I>e.g.,</I>&nbsp;that a critical section must not be split between
the kernel-mode and user-mode components.  Further, the cut should be optimal:
it should mimimize both the weight of edges crossing the cut and the weight of
nodes on the critical side of the cut.  All nodes on the critical side of the
cut are marked critical, and the remaining nodes are non-critical.
Intuitively, such a cut minimizes the number of switches between protection
domains and also the amount of code running in the kernel. 

<P>
<b>The code generator.</b> The code generator uses the critical functions
identified and emits code for the kernel-mode and user-mode components.  It
also generates all the code to handle upcalls and downcalls, including stubs
and code to marshal/unmarshal data structures.  The object tracker and
threadpool implementation (for the multithreaded user-mode component) are
common to all microdrivers and need to be written just once.

<P>

</DIV>

<P> The code generator needs <I>marshaling annotations</I> to guide the
generation of marshaling/unmarshaling code. These annotations are used to
specify the length of dynamically allocated arrays, linked lists and other
complex data structures. The code generator employs a conservative static
analysis algorithm to identify variables that represent such data structures
and prompts the user to provide these annotations. This potentially reduces the
traditional burden associated with annotation, because the user does not have
to provide annotations beforehand, but only as guided by the code generator,
and only for data structures that cross the user/kernel boundary.  For example,
for the e1000 device driver, the code generator automatically infers that
variables of type <TT><FONT>struct e1000_rx_ring</FONT></TT> and
<TT><FONT>struct e1000_tx_ring</FONT></TT> (among others) are arrays. These
denote ring buffers that are allocated by the e1000 driver at startup. It
requests marshaling annotations for each function call that crosses
address-spaces and potentially modifies these data structures. The user must
supply marshaling annotations that determine the length of these data
structures (or supply predicates, <I>e.g.,</I>&nbsp;those that determine how to
stop traversing a linked list).

5. Implementation and experiments
</H2>

<P>
We have implemented several portions of the microdriver architecture and the
refactoring tool. In particular, the refactoring tool automatically identifies
a split and generates code for the kernel- and user-mode components. We have
also implemented a static analysis algorithm to infer where marshaling
annotations are necessary and are currently in the process of integrating this
with the code-generator for marshaling/unmarshaling.  To date, we have applied
the tool to several network drivers. Because our infrastructure is still in
development, we report our experience simulating the operation of an e1000
microdriver. In particular, we used our tool to generate code for the kernel- and
user-mode components, and ran both the components in the kernel address-space,
using delays to simulate change of protection domains.

</DIV>

<P> The kernel-mode component of our e1000 microdriver contains just 25% of the
code of the entire microdriver.  In our experiments, we ran the e1000
microdriver on a dual-core 3Ghz Pentium-D machine running Linux-2.6.18.  We
measured network throughput and CPU utilization using <TT><FONT
SIZE="-1">netperf</FONT></TT> to send TCP packets (results for TCP/receive were
similar and are omitted). We used buffers of size 256KB on both the sending and
receiving side and trasmitted 32KB messages.  <A HREF="#figure:results">Figure
4</A> compares the network throughput and CPU utilization of the e1000
microdriver (with different values for delays) against a traditional e1000
device driver running under the same conditions. We observed that the
microdriver has negligible overheads for network throughput and CPU utilization
for delays under 10 microseconds. Even with a 20 millisecond delay (60,000,000
machine cycles) we only observed a 6.3% drop in network throughput and 26%
increase in CPU utilization.  These results show that microdrivers reduce the
amount of driver code running in the kernel without affecting common-case
performance, and are thus a viable alternative to traditional device drivers.

6. Related work
</H2>

<P> <B>Hardware-based isolation.</B> Several architectures use hardware-based
mechanisms to isolate faults in kernel extensions, in particular device
drivers. These include Nooks&nbsp;[<A HREF="hotos2007.html#sbl05">22</A>] and
VMM-based mechanisms&nbsp;[<A HREF="hotos2007.html#fhn+04">11</A>,<A
HREF="hotos2007.html#lus+04">15</A>] that run each driver in its own protection
domain. Microdrivers also use hardware, in particular, the process boundary, to
isolate large parts (but not the entire) device driver. However, microdrivers
can potentially perform better than these hardware-based isolation mechanisms
because performance-critical code resides and executes in kernel address-space.
In addition, microdrivers also reduce the amount of code running in the kernel.
Microkernels (<I>e.g.,</I>&nbsp;[<A HREF="hotos2007.html#l95">16</A>,<A
HREF="hotos2007.html#vanmaren99">23</A>,<A
HREF="hotos2007.html#yab+86">25</A>]) also use the process boundary to isolate
device drivers, and explicitly aim to reduce the amount of code executing with
kernel privilege, but do so at the cost of reduced performance.  Microdrivers
offer poorer isolation than microkernels, but promise better performance.

<P> Several recent efforts have focused on reducing the amount of driver code
running in commodity operating system kernels&nbsp;[<A

FUSD framework&nbsp;[<A HREF="hotos2007.html#e03">8</A>] and the Microsoft
user-mode driver framework&nbsp;[<A HREF="hotos2007.html#msudf">17</A>] offer
APIs to program user-mode device drivers that communicate with a kernel module.
Chubb&nbsp;[<A HREF="hotos2007.html#c04">7</A>] and Leslie <I>et
al.</I>&nbsp;[<A HREF="hotos2007.html#lcf+05">14</A>] report user-mode driver
performance comparable to in-kernel device drivers. However, unlike
microdrivers, they require both kernel support, and rewriting device drivers,
making them incompatible with existing operating systems.

HREF="hotos2007.html#zca+06">27</A>] is a recent effort to improve device
driver reliability by preventing type safety violations (and is similar in
spirit to SFI&nbsp;[<A HREF="hotos2007.html#wlg93">24</A>]). SafeDrive reports
good performance and is compatible with commodity operating systems. However,
unlike microdrivers, SafeDrive does not reduce the amount of in-kernel code.
Moreover, it does not offer protection against bugs that do not violate type
safety (<I>e.g.,</I>&nbsp;violation of the locking protocol or other kernel API
usage rules).

<P> <B>Program partitioning.</B> Automatic and semi-automatic program
partitioning techniques, much like the ones in <A
HREF="#section:refactor">Section 4</A>, have also been applied to improve
application security&nbsp;[<A HREF="hotos2007.html#bs04">5</A>,<A
HREF="hotos2007.html#zzn+02">26</A>] and to improve the performance of
distributed components&nbsp;[<A HREF="hotos2007.html#hs99">12</A>] and
data-intensive user applications&nbsp;[<A HREF="hotos2007.html#pws+03">20</A>].

7. Conclusions
</H2>

<P> Microdrivers are a promising alternative to existing architectures for
device drivers.  They can improve system reliability by reducing the amount of
code running in the kernel without adversely affecting common-case performance.
Because microdrivers are compatible with commodity operating systems, they
offer a path for running existing device drivers in user-mode with good
common-case performance. This paper also shows that program analysis and
transformation techniques can refactor existing drivers nearly automatically
into microdrivers.
