This article is a revised and expanded version of a paper published at the 13th
International Symposium on Recent Advances in Intrusion Detection (RAID 2010).
It contains the following additional material that does not appear in the RAID
2010 paper:

* Experiments with publicly-available traces: The RAID paper contains numbers
  from experiments that we performed using network traces collected in our
  departmental network. These traces are not available publicly because of
  privacy concerns. To ensure that our experiments are repeateable by other
  researchers, we additionally conducted experiments with publicly available
  network traces (in particular, the 1999 DARPA IDS evaluation traces) with 
  results similar to those obtained using traces from our departmental network.
  (Section 4.1 and Section 5)

* Evaluation of the impact of OBDD variable ordering: We report our analysis
  on the impact of various OBDD variable orderings on the performance of
  NFA-OBDDs. (Section 5.6)

* Description and evaluation of alphabet compression: Our work uses a variant
  of prior alphabet compression algorithms to produce 2-stride NFAs. Our
  algorithm can compress larger sets of regular expressions for 2-stride NFAs
  than prior algorithms. We describe this algorithm in Section 6.3 and also 
  describe the construction of 2-stride NFAs in detail.

In addition to the above major contributions over the conference version, 
the present article also incorporates several minor improvements, such as
an enhanced exposition of background material, and an expanded discussion
of future research directions.
