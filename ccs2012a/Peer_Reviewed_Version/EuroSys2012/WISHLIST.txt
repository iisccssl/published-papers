A wishlist of tasks that were lacking in the EuroSys'12 submission:

1. Experiments with the tap driver for the write workload in the storage SD.

2. Implementing one more SD, particularly, a network SD.

3. Comparison with SICE.

4. Reporting the size (LOC) of various components: domB, #lines in Xen, etc.
