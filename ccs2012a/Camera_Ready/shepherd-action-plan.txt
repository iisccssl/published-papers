Here is a draft of the paper that addresses reviewer concerns. It follows 
the shepherding plan that we laid out in our prior email. To make changes
easy to locate, we have highlighted revised text in red font (with the 
exception of Section 5, which contains new text).

The main changes to the paper are as follows:

* We fixed the protocol in Figure 3(a) using reviewer#5's suggestion, and
  appropriately modified the text of the paper that describes this protocol.

* We eliminated section 2 of the paper, moving some of its key points to the
  end of the introduction section, and to the new discussion section (see
  below)

* We introduced a new discussion section (Section 5) specifically to address 
  the concerns raised by reviewer#6. This section covers details of the 
  TPM/vTPM, including:
  * a description of how clients could obtain the necessary vTPM AIK keys;
  * a discussion of the implications of key distribution to revealing details
    of the cloud platform to competitors;
  * a discussion of the implications of revealing measurements of the software
    stack.
  This section also covers VM migration and hosting issues (again raised by 
  reviewer#6) and issues regarding client technical knowhow.
