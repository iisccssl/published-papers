Latest TODO for CCS:

* In section 3.1, talk about limitations only after you have talked about how
 the system works.


* Make sure that we consistently use "bookkeeping", "logs" or "read/write sets"


TODO List for final polishing of the paper:

* Consistent use of STM, STM runtime, STM techniques, and TM.
  
	We should use STM as just an abbreviation, STM runtime to refer to 
	the set of mechanisms such as read/write sets, commit/abort, etc.,
	and STM techniques for different algorithms/designs that have been
	proposed in the literature.


* Design section to be made more abstract.
  
	Fingerprints to be moved into a separate subsection.
	Reduce implementation detail in the I/O and Library subsections.


* Implementation:
  
	FreeCS: Make several commands transactional (no policies, though).
	        Ensure that our old policies are still enforced.
  Claros: To be ported. 


* Introduction:
  To address Liviu's comments. Abstract to be modified too?

* X server example in Intro: Change to chat server example?

* STM runtime vs STM runtime system

* multi-threaded vs concurrency.

* transaction{...} vs. transactional code segments.

* Change motivation section to use chat server example instead.

* Cite One way isolation.
