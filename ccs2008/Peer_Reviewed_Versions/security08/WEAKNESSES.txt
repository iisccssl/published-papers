1. Implementation consists of only one large benchmark.

2. No quantitative evidence of the amount of error-handling code that we can 
   save using our techniques.

3. We don't have performance evaluation for large benchmarks.

4. We need to be able to say: "We replaced FreeCS's enforcement mechanism and
   made it use TMI to enforce policies instead". We also need to say: "In all,
   we wrote XYZ fingerprints for FreeCS"
