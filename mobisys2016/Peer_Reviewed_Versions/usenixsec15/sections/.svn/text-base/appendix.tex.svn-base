\section{Application Robustness Experiments}
\label{section:robustness}

Installing a dummy driver disables the peripheral, but how does it affect the
user app that is using the peripheral? To answer this question, we conducted
two sets of experiments involving a number of client user apps that leverage
the periperhals shown in \figref{table:uninstall}. 

In the first set of experiments, which we call the \textit{passive setting}, we
start with a configuration where the client app is not executing, replace the
device driver of the peripheral with a dummy, and then start the app. In the
second set of experiments, called the \textit{active setting}, we replace the
periperhal's device driver with the dummy as the client app that uses the
peripheral is executing. 

\figref{table:robustness} shows the results of our experiments. For both the
passive and active settings, we observe that in most cases, the user app
displays a suitable error message or changes its behavior by displaying a blank
screen or creating an empty audio file. In some cases, particularly in the
passive setting, the app fails to start when the driver is replaced, and the
Android runtime displays an error that it is unable to start the app.
