Smart personal devices have become ubiquitous, and we increasingly rely on
their use in our daily lives. Simultaneously, society is beginning to place
restrictions on how these devices can be used in various environments. Such
\textit{restricted spaces} abound in today's society. For example, enterprises
and federal offices that store sensitive information place restrictions on the
use of cameras and microphones in smart devices. In classrooms, students are
often disallowed from using smart devices during examinations. And in social
settings, people are unwilling to have their conversations recorded by their
friends wearing smart glasses. To date, these restrictions have been enforced
using \adhoc\ methods.

In this paper, we present a systematic approach for restricted space hosts to
remotely analyze and regulate guest device use in the restricted space.
Policies governing device use are decided by the hosts that control the
restricted space. These policies are enforced by a trusted mechanism that
executes on the smart guest device. We present an implementation of our
mechanism on smart devices equipped with the ARM TrustZone architecture. We
also present candidate policies that show how device use can be regulated in a
variety of restricted spaces.
